# Landlord Simulator
### ~ A text based adventure

This is a simple Java application, built initially to explore and solidify an understanding and use for the four 
pillars of OOP. This was done through a number of classes and one interface ("Building").

Within this application/game, the player's objective is to manage their finances as a stay-at-home landlord. In doing so,
the player may encounter financial hardship, moral dilemmas, heart-wrenching drama, and incredible wealth.
